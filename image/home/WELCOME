Welcome to the Docker image for NumGeom desktop environment!

This image is based on Ubuntu 18.04, with LyX 2.3, Visual Studio Code,
Octave 4.2.2, SciPy and Spyder for Python 3.6, Jupyter Notebook for Python 
and Octave, g++-7.3, LAPACK, ddd, valgrind, and various editors preinstalled.

Please save your code and data into the ~/shared or ~/project directories.
The former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter
maps to the Docker data volume named lyx_project on your host.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host 
computer is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in a terminal 
to add your ssh key to the ssh-agent.
